      <h2>How to Protect Your Digital Privacy</h2>
      <img src="privacy-protection.jpg" alt="Digital Privacy Protection" class="section-image">
      <p>Here are some important steps you can take to protect your digital privacy and keep your personal information safe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Create strong passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts. Consider using a password manager to keep track of your credentials securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Use two-factor authentication on your accounts to add an extra layer of security. 2FA requires you to verify your identity using a second method (e.g., a code sent to your phone) in addition to your password.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Cautious with Personal Information:</strong> Avoid sharing unnecessary personal details online. Be mindful of what you post on social media and make sure your privacy settings are properly configured.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Secure Connections (HTTPS):</strong> Ensure that the websites you visit are secure by checking for "https://" in the URL. This ensures that the connection between your browser and the website is encrypted and secure.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Software and Devices Updated:</strong> Regularly update your devices, operating systems, and applications to fix security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Suspicious Emails and Links:</strong> Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages, especially those that ask for sensitive information. Always verify the sender’s identity before clicking on any links or opening attachments.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition to protecting your privacy, following general online safety best practices will help ensure a safer experience on the internet:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network):</strong> A VPN encrypts your internet connection, providing anonymity and security when browsing the web, especially on public Wi-Fi networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Your Accounts Regularly:</strong> Regularly check your financial accounts, social media, and email accounts for any suspicious activity or unauthorized transactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Install Security Software:</strong> Use antivirus, anti-malware, and firewall software to protect your devices from cyber threats. Make sure they are always up to date.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Geolocation Sharing:</strong> Turn off geolocation services or limit which apps and websites can access your location to protect your privacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Review App Permissions:</strong> Be mindful of the permissions granted to apps and websites. Disable unnecessary permissions, such as access to contacts, camera, or microphone, unless required for the app's functionality.</li>
      </ul>
