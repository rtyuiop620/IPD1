      <img src="copyright.jpg" alt="Copyright Concept" class="section-image">
      <p>Copyright is a legal concept that grants creators of original works exclusive rights to their creations. This includes works such as written texts, music, videos, and software. Copyright protects the creator's intellectual property, preventing others from using, copying, or distributing their work without permission.</p>
      <p>Respecting copyright means understanding when and how you can use someone else's work. It’s important to follow the rules about copyright to avoid legal issues and honor creators' rights.</p>

      <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
      <img src="plagiarism.jpg" alt="Plagiarism Concept" class="section-image">
      <p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or expressions without giving them proper credit. This can include copying text, images, videos, and other content without acknowledgment. Plagiarism is considered unethical and can lead to serious consequences in both academic and professional settings.</p>
      <p>To avoid plagiarism, always cite your sources, give proper credit to authors and creators, and ensure that you use original content whenever possible. When borrowing ideas or content, it's essential to reference them correctly according to the appropriate citation style.</p>

      <p>Respecting others online means treating people with kindness, fairness, and consideration, just as you would in face-to-face interactions. Online spaces should be safe, inclusive, and supportive, where individuals can freely express their thoughts without fear of harassment or discrimination.</p>
      <p>Here are key principles to follow when interacting with others online:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Courteous:</strong> Engage in respectful communication, avoid offensive language, and refrain from making hurtful comments or personal attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cyberbullying:</strong> Cyberbullying involves harassing, threatening, or demeaning others through digital platforms. Be mindful of your tone and language when communicating online.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect Privacy:</strong> Respect people's privacy by not sharing their personal information without consent. Think twice before posting content that could invade someone else's privacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Foster Inclusivity:</strong> Encourage diversity of thought and expression while avoiding exclusionary or discriminatory behavior in online discussions and communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Honest:</strong> Honesty in communication is essential. Avoid spreading rumors, misinformation, or engaging in deceitful behavior online.</li>

      <img src="best-practices.jpg" alt="Best Practices for Copyright and Plagiarism" class="section-image">
      <p>To maintain ethical online behavior, follow these best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Always Cite Your Sources:</strong> Whether you are writing an academic paper, creating content, or sharing information online, always give credit to the original creator. Use the correct citation style (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago) for your sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Public Domain or Creative Commons Resources:</strong> When possible, use resources that are freely available for use. Public domain works and Creative Commons licensed content are often free to use with proper attribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for Permission:</strong> If you want to use someone else’s work, reach out to them and request permission. This ensures that you are respecting their intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Learn About Fair Use:</strong> Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted materials without permission for specific purposes like criticism, commentary, or educational use. However, it’s important to understand the rules around fair use before applying it to your work.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Original Content:</strong> Create and share your original work whenever possible. It not only avoids plagiarism but also adds value to the digital world by sharing new and unique ideas.</li>
      </ul>
