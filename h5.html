      <p>To determine if a source is trustworthy, look for the following characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Authority:</strong> Is the source an expert or reputable institution in the field? Look for authors with credentials, academic institutions, or well-known organizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Does the information align with facts from multiple reputable sources? Check for citations, references, and the consistency of the content.</li>
        <li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> Is the content free from bias and presenting all sides of the argument? A reliable source provides a balanced view without pushing a particular agenda.</li>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Is the information up-to-date? In fields like technology and medicine, recent data is crucial to ensure relevance.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Does the source provide clear information about the authors, funding, or possible conflicts of interest? Trustworthy sources are open about their backgrounds.</li>

      <p>When evaluating online sources, consider the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the Domain:</strong> Educational institutions (.edu), government websites (.gov), and well-established news outlets (.org or .com) tend to be reliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Examine the Author:</strong> Research the qualifications and expertise of the author. Are they an authority on the topic they are writing about?</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Check with Other Sources:</strong> Compare the information with other reputable sources. If multiple credible sources report the same information, itâ€™s more likely to be accurate.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for Citations and References:</strong> Reliable sources often provide references to primary research or data to support their claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Clickbait:</strong> Be cautious of sensationalized headlines or articles that seem designed to grab attention rather than inform. These may be misleading or false.</li>
      </ul>
