      <h2>Internet Connectivity Issues</h2>
      <img src="internet-connectivity.jpg" alt="Internet Connectivity Issues" class="section-image">
      <p>Internet connectivity issues can occur due to various factors such as router problems, network congestion, or issues with your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Here are some steps to troubleshoot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the Modem and Router:</strong> Ensure that both your modem and router are powered on and the lights are blinking normally. Restart them by unplugging for 30 seconds and plugging them back in.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Wi-Fi Settings:</strong> Make sure your device is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network. Try disconnecting and reconnecting, or moving closer to the router.</li>
        <li><strong>Test with Another Device:</strong> Check if other devices can connect to the internet. If they can, the issue may be with your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Restart Your Device:</strong> Restarting your device can resolve many connectivity issues by refreshing network settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Run a Speed Test:</strong> Use an online speed test tool to check your internet speed. If the speed is slower than expected, contact your ISP for assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Your ISP:</strong> If the issue persists, contact your ISP to check for outages or technical issues in your area.</li>

      <h2>Slow Device Performance</h2>
      <img src="slow-device.jpg" alt="Slow Device Performance" class="section-image">
      <p>Devices can slow down over time due to a variety of reasons such as insufficient memory, outdated software, or malware. Here are some ways to troubleshoot and improve performance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Close Unnecessary Programs:</strong> If your device is running slowly, close any programs or tabs that you are not using to free up system resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Cache and Temporary Files:</strong> Over time, cached files and temporary files can accumulate and slow down your device. Use built-in tools to clear these files.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Software and Drivers:</strong> Ensure your operating system, software, and drivers are up to date to avoid bugs and improve performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Free Up Disk Space:</strong> Check the storage on your device. Delete unnecessary files, uninstall unused apps, or move files to external storage to free up space.</li>
        <li><strong>Run a System Scan:</strong> Perform a virus and malware scan to ensure your device is not being slowed down by malicious software.</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade Hardware:</strong> If your device is still slow, consider upgrading its hardware, such as increasing RAM or switching to a solid-state drive (SSD) for faster performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Application Crashes and Freezes</h2>
      <img src="app-crashes.jpg" alt="Application Crashes and Freezes" class="section-image">
      <p>Application crashes and freezes are common issues that can disrupt work. If you are facing frequent application issues, try these steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Restart the Application:</strong> Close and reopen the application to see if the issue resolves itself. If the app is unresponsive, force quit it from the task manager (Windows) or activity monitor (Mac).</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Updates:</strong> Make sure the application is up to date. Developers often release bug fixes and stability improvements in updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear App Cache:</strong> Some apps store temporary files that can cause performance issues. Clear the app’s cache through its settings or by using a system cleaner.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinstall the App:</strong> If the issue persists, uninstall the app and reinstall it. This can resolve issues caused by corrupt files or settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Check System Requirements:</strong> Ensure your device meets the minimum system requirements for the application to run smoothly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Printer Issues</h2>
      <img src="printer-issues.jpg" alt="Printer Issues" class="section-image">
      <p>If you're having trouble printing, try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the Printer Connection:</strong> Ensure the printer is connected to your device via USB or Wi-Fi and powered on. For wireless printers, make sure it is connected to the correct network.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Ink or Toner Levels:</strong> Low ink or toner can cause printing issues. Check the printer's ink levels and replace cartridges if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Restart the Printer and Device:</strong> Turn off both the printer and your computer, wait a few seconds, then restart both devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Printer Drivers:</strong> Ensure that your printer drivers are up to date. Visit the printer manufacturer’s website to download and install the latest drivers.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Print Queue:</strong> If print jobs are stuck in the queue, clear the print queue and try printing again.</li>
        <li><strong>Run Printer Troubleshooter:</strong> Most operating systems offer built-in printer troubleshooting tools. Use these tools to automatically diagnose and fix common printer problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Slow Internet Speed</h2>
      <img src="slow-internet-speed.jpg" alt="Slow Internet Speed" class="section-image">
      <p>If your internet speed is slower than expected, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check for Network Congestion:</strong> Multiple devices using the internet at once can slow down the connection. Disconnect unused devices or limit streaming and downloads.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Wired Connection:</strong> Wi-Fi connections can be slower and less reliable than wired connections. If possible, connect your device directly to the router using an Ethernet cable.</li>
        <li><strong>Reset Your Modem/Router:</strong> Restart your modem and router to refresh the connection and resolve any temporary network issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Your ISP:</strong> If the problem persists, contact your ISP to check if there are any outages or issues with your internet plan.</li>
