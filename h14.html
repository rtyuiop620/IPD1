      <h2>Why Strong Passwords Matter</h2>
      <img src="strong-password.jpg" alt="Strong Password" class="section-image">
      <p>A strong password is one of the most important defenses against unauthorized access to your accounts. Weak passwords make it easier for attackers to guess or crack your credentials, putting your personal data and accounts at risk. A strong password is difficult to guess, even for advanced tools and hackers.</p>

      <h2>Characteristics of a Strong Password</h2>
      <img src="password-criteria.jpg" alt="Password Criteria" class="section-image">
      <p>To create a strong password, follow these guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Length:</strong> Aim for at least 12 characters. Longer passwords are harder to crack.</li>
        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Use a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $).</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Common Words:</strong> Don’t use easily guessable information such as your name, birthday, or simple dictionary words. Also, avoid using predictable patterns like “123456” or “password”.</li>
        <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Use a different password for each account to prevent a breach on one site from affecting your other accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Randomness:</strong> The more random your password is, the harder it will be to guess. Consider using a passphrase (a sequence of random words) or a password manager to generate strong passwords for you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Create a Strong Password</h2>
      <img src="create-password.jpg" alt="Creating a Strong Password" class="section-image">
      <p>Follow these simple steps to create a strong and secure password:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Think of a sentence or phrase:</strong> Choose a phrase that’s easy to remember but hard to guess. For example, "I love coffee at 7 AM!"</li>
        <li><strong>Convert the phrase into a password:</strong> Use the first letters of each word and replace some letters with numbers or symbols, like "Il0veC0ff33@7AM!"</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Password Manager:</strong> Password managers can generate and store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This way, you don’t have to remember them all yourself.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h2>
      <img src="2fa.jpg" alt="Two-Factor Authentication" class="section-image">
      <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional layer of security to your accounts. Instead of just entering your password, you’ll also need to provide a second piece of information, which can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Something you know:</strong> Your password.</li>
        <li><strong>Something you have:</strong> A physical device, such as your smartphone or security token, that generates or receives a one-time code.</li>
        <li><strong>Something you are:</strong> A biometric factor such as your fingerprint, facial recognition, or voice recognition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if a hacker gets hold of your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the second factor of authentication.</p>

      <h2>How to Set Up Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
      <img src="set-up-2fa.jpg" alt="Setting Up 2FA" class="section-image">
      <p>Setting up 2FA for your accounts is a great way to boost security. Here’s how you can do it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Check if 2FA is available:</strong> Most major websites and services (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) offer 2FA as an option. Look for the security settings in your account settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose your 2FA method:</strong> You can choose between receiving an authentication code via text message (SMS), using an authentication app (like Google Authenticator or Authy), or using a hardware key (like a Yubikey).</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the setup instructions:</strong> Once you choose your method, the service will provide step-by-step instructions to link your device and enable 2FA. You may need to scan a QR code or enter a verification code to complete the setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup codes:</strong> Most services provide backup codes when you enable 2FA. Store these codes in a secure place in case you lose access to your 2FA device.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Advantages of Using Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
      <img src="advantages-2fa.jpg" alt="Advantages of 2FA" class="section-image">
      <p>Using 2FA significantly improves the security of your accounts. Some of the key advantages include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Even if someone knows your password, they can’t access your account without the second factor.</li>
        <li><strong>Protection Against Data Breaches:</strong> 2FA reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to stolen passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> Knowing your accounts are secured with an additional layer of protection helps reduce stress about your personal information being compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Widely Supported:</strong> Many popular services, from email providers to social media platforms and financial institutions, support 2FA, making it easy to secure your accounts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Best Practices for Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
      <img src="best-practices.jpg" alt="Password and 2FA Best Practices" class="section-image">
      <p>To ensure maximum security, consider these best practices for passwords and 2FA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Password Manager:</strong> Store your complex passwords in a trusted password manager to keep them secure and easily accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable 2FA Everywhere:</strong> Enable two-factor authentication for all accounts that support it, especially for email, banking, and social media accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Reuse Passwords:</strong> Always use unique passwords for each account to prevent a breach in one account from compromising others.</li>
        <li><strong>Change Passwords Regularly:</strong> Periodically change your passwords, especially if you suspect any of your accounts may have been compromised.</li>
      </ul>
