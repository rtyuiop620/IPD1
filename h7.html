      <p>To maintain an effective and secure email account, consider the following best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regularly Clean Your Inbox:</strong> Delete or archive old emails to free up space. This helps you keep your inbox organized and improves email performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Your Password:</strong> Change your password regularly to improve security. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for a strong password.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> For added security, enable two-factor authentication. This requires you to verify your identity via a secondary method, such as a mobile app, in addition to your password.</li>
        <li><strong>Review Security Settings:</strong> Periodically check your email account’s security settings, including recovery options and authorized devices. Remove any devices or applications you no longer use.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup Important Emails:</strong> If you have crucial emails, download or back them up to cloud storage to ensure you don’t lose valuable information.</li>
      </ul>
