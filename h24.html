      <h2>What are Smart Devices?</h2>
      <img src="smart-devices.jpg" alt="Smart Devices" class="section-image">
      <p>Smart devices are electronic gadgets that are connected to the internet and can communicate with other devices or networks. These devices typically use sensors, actuators, and processors to perform specific tasks and are capable of gathering, processing, and exchanging data automatically.</p>
      
      <h3>Examples of Smart Devices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smartphones:</strong> Mobile phones that not only provide traditional communication services but also offer internet browsing, app usage, and a host of other functionalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart TVs:</strong> Televisions connected to the internet that allow streaming services like Netflix, YouTube, and more, as well as integration with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Speakers:</strong> Devices like Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod that use voice recognition to perform tasks such as playing music, controlling home automation, and answering queries.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Thermostats:</strong> Devices like the Nest Thermostat that allow you to control home temperature remotely and learn your preferences over time to optimize energy use.</li>
        <li><strong>Wearables:</strong> Devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) that monitor health data and provide real-time notifications and communication features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?</h2>
      <img src="iot.jpg" alt="Internet of Things" class="section-image">
      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects or “things” that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies, enabling them to connect and exchange data over the internet. These objects can range from everyday household items to industrial machines, all communicating with each other to automate and optimize tasks.</p>
      
      <h3>How Does IoT Work?</h3>
      <p>IoT devices are equipped with sensors that collect data from the environment, which is then sent over the internet to a central server or cloud platform. This data is analyzed and used to make decisions or send commands back to the devices. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smart Home Automation:</strong> IoT devices like smart lights, thermostats, and security cameras can communicate with each other to adjust home settings based on user preferences or external factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Wearable IoT devices like smartwatches track heart rate, steps, and sleep patterns, syncing the data to your phone for detailed insights into your health.</li>
        <li><strong>Connected Cars:</strong> Vehicles with IoT technology can share data about their location, performance, and even alert drivers about maintenance needs or traffic conditions.</li>
      </ul>
